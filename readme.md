# PS Vita Game Lister
> Because the Python one didn't work for me

Written in PowerShell, only tessted on 7.3; *might* work on 5.1, but I'm not testing that.

I wrote this because I wanted to recover the list of games installed on my PS Vita's microSD card after the console died.  
I did see [this one](https://github.com/AzimovParviz/PSVitaGameLister) written in Python, but trying to run it just gave me an error.  
Requires a valid PSV_GAMES.TSV file.

Yes, it's really slow. But it works!
